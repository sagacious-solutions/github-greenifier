# Github Greenifier Bot

As a developer, I firmly believe well written and tested code is of utmost importance. Never write 100 lines when 10 will do. More lines, means more complexity, and more complexity increases risk of technical debt and failure. 

Therefore this project is to make my github look more green at a glance while I spend time upskilling and working on more technically challenging projects.
